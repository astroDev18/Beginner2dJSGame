# 2D RPG Simulation in JavaScript using Custom Game Engine.

A 2d JavaScript RPG Game I created entirely from scratch with a custom built game engine to handle audio, movement, graphics, collisions, and pathfinding. It uses A* Pathfinding to move the character around by clicking. The game has full animations with Sprites from an animation loader.

You can play it by clicking with the right mouse button to move around the map. It does not have any enemies as I never reached that point. There are collisions, and you can drag the map by clicking and dragging with the scroll wheel. 

You can see it live here:
